The specific mechanics were thrown together on the spot but everyone had a good time. The treasure golem is a rewarding encounter for it's theme and spectacle, not it's mechanical depth. However it has a few tricks up it's sleeve.</p>\n<p>This could be used as a the primary or final means of defence. If it's the primary foe in a location then you could make it more difficult or complex mechanically. If it's the final enemy after a long slog through a dungeon or following a dragon fight then perhaps tone down the difficulty for a weakened party. the story of the battle will be just as rewarding as the treasure itself. I include some suggested alterations at the end.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandman from Spiderman</li>\n<li>cone attack that applies slow</li>\n<li>Can charge over enemies, also applying slow</li>\n<li>As it takes damage it reduces in size and damage output.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optional to have the creature split and combine as needed for drama.</p>\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/HJxYacZSV\"\ntitle=\"title of iframe content\"\nheight=\"1060px\";\nwidth=\"813px\";\nloading=\"lazy\">","frontmatter":{"title":"Treasure Golem","date":"Mar 24, 2022","description":"A fun challenge hiding in a treasure hoard.","tags":["D&D"],"cover":null,"coverAlt":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/treasure-golem/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/thinking-in-abstractions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking In Abstractions"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1607591362","3649515864","63159454"]}
