These things have slowly changed over time during my career and will change again in the future.</p>\n<h2>Editor, Terminal, Browser etc.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> has been my bread and butter for maybe 5 years now, you can pry it from my cold dead hands.</li>\n<li>I've customised VSC with years of settings tweaks and extensions to tailor it to my needs. <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/matt123miller\">Let me know</a> if there's an extensions I should know about!</li>\n<li>I prefer dark themes for everything and I'm almost always using <a href=\"https://draculatheme.com/\">Dracula</a> üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"https://zsh.sourceforge.io/\">ZSH</a> as my shell, alongside the <a href=\"https://spaceship-prompt.sh/\">Spaceship prompt</a> which is a Rust powered prompt that provides some extra sugar.</li>\n<li>I'm an annoyingly vocal <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/\">Firefox</a> fan ü¶ä, not only due to their best in class dev tools and focus on user privacy but because everything else is running on Chromium and Blink now, the web needs a competing browser engine.</li>\n<li>All my dev tools use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">Fira Code</a> font as I like the ligatures and find it very readable.</li>\n<li>I store my various OS and software configs and setup scripts in my <a href=\"https://github.com/matt123miller/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> repo. Feel free to use it as inspiration but it's obviously for my own uses and may not be appropriate for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's on my desk?</h2>\n<p>I have too many computers at the moment and I'm working on simplifying everything. I'm an OS polyglot though prefer a *nix environment for dev work. All my *nix knowhow is self taught though, always learning and breaking things as I go....</p>\n<p>My desk currently contains any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>üçè M1 MacBook Air as my primary development machine. It's the pink one ü§ò.</li>\n<li>üíª Windows desktop, mostly for gaming. BIOS and storage drives are a mess from too much multi-OS booting.</li>\n<li>üíª Microsoft Surface Go with pen, which I love but it's niche has been replaced by the MBA, poor thing. Great for taking notes and reading ebooks though.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are alongside various peripherals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>üñ±Ô∏è A logitech MX Master 3, the best mouse I've ever used.</li>\n<li>‚å®Ô∏è Keychron K6 mechanical, fun to type on and has pretty lights.</li>\n<li>‚å®Ô∏è Microsoft surface ergonomic, pure bliss for the hands and wrists.</li>\n<li>üñ•Ô∏è I'm sorely lacking in monitors, using some cheap, mismatched 1080p screens. But this will be my next hardware investment for sure.</li>\n<li>üì∑ Logitech C920 webcam. Glad I bought this a few years back before all quality webcam stocks disappeared.</li>\n<li>üéß Sony WH-1000 XM3 bluetooth headphones. Ridiculous noise cancelling, very comfortable (unless it's hot weather) and multi day battery life.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Uses","date":"Jul 05, 2021","description":"A summary of what I use day to day.","tags":["Tech"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/0a83b/desk.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/75d2c/desk.jpg 200w,\n/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/a9994/desk.jpg 400w,\n/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/0a83b/desk.jpg 800w,\n/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/26aee/desk.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/9c20a/desk.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8b90c2f1cf432e7c53e92f44854018bc/57552/desk.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"coverAlt":"Image of my desk, comprising my macbook, 2 screens, a keyboard and various clutter"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/uses/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/D&D&Me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"D&D&Me"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/thinking-in-abstractions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking In Abstractions"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1607591362","3649515864","63159454"]}
