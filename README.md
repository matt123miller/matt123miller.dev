# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal site [https://matt123miller.dev](https://matt123miller.dev).

It's been on the back burner for probably a year. But I've finally found a setup that's easy enough to maintain and add to.

Created using  and  with  lending a helping hand. Initial setup performed by .

## Main technology decisions

- Node
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/)
- Project was generated by [create-nuxt-app](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app)
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss)
- [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io)
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)

## Scripts

 Title | Command | Description 
 --- | --- | ---
 Dev | `npm run dev` | Runs `nuxt` on it's own which will provide automatic reloading on save and whatnot
 Dev Debug | `npm run dev-debug` | Theoretically runs nuxt via the debugger so I can debug server side code. Has mixed results.
 Build | `npm run build` | Builds the project in universal SSR mode for deployment on the server.
 Generate | `npm run generate` | Nuxt will generate a static site from my project. I've yet to try this
 Lint | `npm run lint` | Runs `eslint` across the codebase with some options 
 Precommit | `npm run precommit` | A script to run in a pre commit hook, though I'm pretty sure it's not working.

## TODO

I'm using the [TODO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) for VSCode. 

You can view the file [here](./TODO).

## Deployment guide

This is entirely for my own benefit.

- ssh into the server
- `git pull` 
- `npm run build`
- `pm2 restart nuxt`

I created the pm2 process using `pm2 start npm --name "nuxt" -- start`
