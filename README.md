# Personal Website

My personal website that's been on the back burner for probably a year. I'll finish it soon...

Created using [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/) with [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) lending a helping hand. Initial setup performed by [create-nuxt-app](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app). Hoping to host on Digital Ocean but who knows!

Now that I know what I'm doing and using this should progress much faster.
