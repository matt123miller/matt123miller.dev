# matt123miller.dev

This is my personal site, a content focused Astro site.

I'm trying to follow the commit guidelines detailed in the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) which mostly follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. My ammendments are the following:

- `content: <description>`

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project has the following structure and files.

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ A folder for each blog post
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Rest of the Astro starter readme

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
