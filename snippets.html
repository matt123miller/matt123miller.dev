      <p>
        I graduated with a first class degree in Computing with Game Development from University of Greenwich in 2017.
        There I leant my foundational skills in Software Development and Engineering. I focused on becoming a great
        programmer, which has helped me broaden my skills into an iOS and Web development!

        My courses were divided amongst programming in various OOP languages, game development, databases, software
        engineering, project management and the development lifecycle.

          investigation into machine learning and it's uses to help classify an
          individuals movement"</a>. This involved creating 2 applications:

          <li>
            A machine learning application with Python to analyse centre of balance data and predict an individuals
            quality of balance and gait.
          </li>
          <li>
            An interactive data gathering tool, written in
