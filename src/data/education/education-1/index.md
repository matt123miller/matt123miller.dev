Graduated from Greenwich with a first class degree, including a sandwich year in industry.
I focused my various module choices towards having a solid basis in development practice and theory, with a side focus in games development.

The foundations of OO design and writing maintainable systems have helped me every day since, first in my iOS work and now as a web developer.
