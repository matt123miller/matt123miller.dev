Returning after my studies in 2017 I continued working for The Frameworks first as an iOS developer and then as a web dev deloper. During this period I worked on various projects for world renowned clients. The stand out projects for me were:
- A browser based Virtual Reality (VR) tour, lovingly handmade in only a few weeks. 
- A website and series of backend services for a social media influencer startup to help them compute engagement metrics, market and audience segregation and the value that each influencer can bring to brands looking to advertise with those influencers.
- [A fun web page](https://www.ibm.com/marketing/uk-en/this-is-ibm/identity) for IBM that showcases some of the impactful work they've done over the years. Each of the images has different hover and click effects, with resizing content that also moves around it's neighbours as appropriate.
- An iOS app for managing fleets of ride share drivers and vehicles, the drivers documentation for legal compliance along with historical data like vehicle repairs or driver paperwork.
