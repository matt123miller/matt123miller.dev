I currently work as a fullstack developer on our Pebble Remote product. This is a MEAN stack application that runs on-prem and in the cloud for customers who use our Pebble Automation product. It interfaces with Pebble Automation to provide a simpler way of performing the common 80% of uses and can be accessed from anywhere.

The project had been unloved and unmaintained for a few years before I was brought on to revitalise it. As the sole developer of this product I work a lot with the product owner and support teams to prioritise what we work on, estimate and scope out new features and fixes and make improvements to the software on a technical level as I see fit.

We'll shortly be releasing some big new features I've been working on and the following release will contain a massive overhaul of our package dependencies which I've been migrating in the background for a long time.
