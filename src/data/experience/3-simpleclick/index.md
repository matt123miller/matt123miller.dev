I currently work as a fullstack developer making websites and other web powered services for a range of local and national clients. My work focuses on improving and maintaining our CMS product, Doddle. This includes working on core modules that all Doddle sites share and client specific modules for more bespoke functionality. 

Some recent client projects include:

- Fred Olsen Cruise Lines - Many projects over the past 2 years, from improving their <a class="animated-link" href="https://www.fredolsencruises.com/">user facing sales site</a>, creating bespoke CMS functionality inside of Doddle or the website that runs on each of their ships displaying cruise information, activities, alerts, restaurant bookings etc. to passengers.

- Waller Transport - <a class="animated-link" href="https://uktechnews.co.uk/2021/02/02/waller-transport-services-launches-new-transport-operating-system-designed-by-simpleclick/">A bespoke digital tracking application</a> to help streamline their business, increase sales, customer conversions and track deliveries from initial quote to delivery of goods.

- Many more client projects that I unfortunately can't tell you about ðŸ¤«.
