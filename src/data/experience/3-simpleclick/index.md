I worked as a fullstack developer making websites and other web powered services for a range of local and national clients. My work focused on improving and maintaining our CMS product, Doddle. This included working on core modules that all Doddle sites share and client specific modules for more bespoke client functionality.

I worked on many interesting client projects during my time at SimpleClick, not all of which I can talk about ðŸ¤«.

But some client projects I can discuss were:

Many highlights over the 2.5 year period, including:

- Improving their [user facing sales site](https://www.fredolsencruises.com/).
- Creating bespoke CMS functionality inside of Doddle
- Improving the website that runs on each of their ships displaying cruise information, activities, alerts, restaurant bookings etc. to passengers.
- Increasing database and page load performance by 50x for vital sales pages

This was our first use of React inside of Doddle which involved a lot of work from the team to introduce it to our front end code and define good patterns for how this would work. This allowed us to develop more interactive Doddle components and better share functionality between the team.

Together we created [a bespoke digital tracking application](https://uktechnews.co.uk/2021/02/02/waller-transport-services-launches-new-transport-operating-system-designed-by-simpleclick/) for their B2B customers. This allowed Waller Transport to streamline their business processes, track and increase customer conversions which resulted in greater sales and track deliveries from initial quote to delivery of goods.

I specifically focused on the order and quote systems, converting those to billable sales and a simpler email and PDF generation system that other developers could integrate into their own work with a simple API.

This was the first project for our new Doddle E-commerce solution and resulted in [a brand new website](https://www.bjwaller.co.uk/) with extensive E-commerce systems. Leveraging the teams new React experience we created a lot of functionality with Doddle to define products, inventory, orders, checkouts, deliveries, sales reports and more. I focused on similar systems to Waller Transport, though there were enough fundamental differences that not much could be reused other than my email and PDF systems which proved flexible and useful enough that no changes were needed.
