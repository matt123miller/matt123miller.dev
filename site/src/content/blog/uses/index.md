Having just set up a new M1 MacBook Air (loving it so far) I thought it was time I created this page summarising the various things I use day to day. These things have slowly changed over time during my career and will change again in the future.

## Editor, Terminal, Browser etc.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been my bread and butter for maybe 5 years now, you can pry it from my cold dead hands.
- I've customised VSC with years of settings tweaks and extensions to tailor it to my needs. [Let me know](https://www.twitter.com/matt123miller) if there's an extensions I should know about!
- I prefer dark themes for everything and I'm almost always using [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- I use [ZSH](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) as my shell, alongside the [Spaceship prompt](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/) which is a Rust powered prompt that provides some extra sugar.
- I'm an annoyingly vocal [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/) fan ü¶ä, not only due to their best in class dev tools and focus on user privacy but because everything else is running on Chromium and Blink now, the web needs a competing browser engine.
- All my dev tools use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font as I like the ligatures and find it very readable.
- I store my various OS and software configs and setup scripts in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/matt123miller/dotfiles) repo. Feel free to use it as inspiration but it's obviously for my own uses and may not be appropriate for you.

## What's on my desk?

I have too many computers at the moment and I'm working on simplifying everything. I'm an OS polyglot though prefer a \*nix environment for dev work. All my \*nix knowhow is self taught though, always learning and breaking things as I go....

My desk currently contains any of the following:

- üçè M1 MacBook Air as my primary development machine. It's the pink one ü§ò.
- üíª Windows desktop, mostly for gaming. BIOS and storage drives are a mess from too much multi-OS booting.
- üíª Microsoft Surface Go with pen, which I love but it's niche has been replaced by the MBA, poor thing. Great for taking notes and reading ebooks though.

These are alongside various peripherals:

- üñ±Ô∏è A logitech MX Master 3, the best mouse I've ever used.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Keychron K6 mechanical, fun to type on and has pretty lights.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Microsoft surface ergonomic, pure bliss for the hands and wrists.
- üñ•Ô∏è I'm sorely lacking in monitors, using some cheap, mismatched 1080p screens. But this will be my next hardware investment for sure.
- üì∑ Logitech C920 webcam. Glad I bought this a few years back before all quality webcam stocks disappeared.
- üéß Sony WH-1000 XM3 bluetooth headphones. Ridiculous noise cancelling, very comfortable (unless it's hot weather) and multi day battery life.
