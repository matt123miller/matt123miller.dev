# My Daily Drivers

Juggling parenting, full time work and hobbies from my one desk means it performs multiple roles.

This page summarises the various things I use day to day. These things have slowly changed over time during my career and will change again in the future.

## Editor, Terminal, Browser etc.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been my bread and butter for roughly 7 years now, you can pry it from my cold dead hands.
- I've customised VSC with years of settings tweaks and extensions to tailor it to my needs. [Let me know](https://www.twitter.com/matt123miller) if there's an extensions I should know about!
- I prefer dark themes for everything and I'm almost always using [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- I'm an annoyingly vocal [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/) fan ü¶ä, not only due to their best in class dev tools and focus on user privacy but because everything else is running on Chromium now, the web needs a competing browser engine.
- All my dev tools use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font as I like the ligatures and find it very readable.
- I've gone back to using bash as my shell as it's ubiquitous, alongside the [Spaceship prompt](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/) which is a Rust powered prompt that provides some extra sugar.
- I store my various OS and software configs and setup scripts in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/matt123miller/dotfiles) repo. Feel free to use it as inspiration but it's obviously for my own uses and may not be appropriate for you.

## What's on my desk?

Whatever hardware my job sends me and my own M1 Mac. These are alongside various peripherals:

- üñ±Ô∏è A logitech MX Master 3, the best mouse I've ever used.
- ‚å®Ô∏è ZSA Moonlander üåô I'd happily use this for the rest of my life. I previously used a Microsoft surface ergonomic which I loved.
- üñ•Ô∏è I'm sorely lacking in monitors, using some cheap, mismatched 1080p screens. But this will be my next hardware investment for sure.
- üì∑ Logitech Streamcam. I'm no camera expert, it always works and delivers clear video in various light levels.
- üéß Sony WH-1000 XM3 bluetooth headphones. Ridiculous noise cancelling, very comfortable (unless it's hot weather) and multi day battery life.
